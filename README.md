# Housing Market
An end-to-end project using Machine Learning, python and django to predict the prices of a house using data. 

The data is first scrapped using beautifulsoup from the website and the scrapped data is stored in a CSV file. The data collected is cleaned and processed using pandas and numpy library and is visualised using Tableau. Regression Analysis is then performed on the clean data. The loss function is measured using Mean Squared Error metric to determine the accuracy of the model.
